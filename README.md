aRt is an R package to create generative art.

## Colour palettes

Some of the functions in previous releases of the {aRt} package took names of colour palettes as arguments. These colour palettes came from external R packages, and the names of the palettes were not necessarily obvious. These functions have been updated to allow any choice of colours, rather than restricting a user to a single package from which to choose palettes.
